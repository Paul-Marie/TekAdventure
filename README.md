# TekAdventure
This is a Simple CSFML Game made in my first Year at Epitech school.
the TekAdventure project goal was to create a mini game in C using CSFML,
but he's now replaced by another project, the "my_rpg" where the goal
is to make a RPG game.

Feel free to play at this game for fun, or just to explore how to use
the CSFML library.
